## Development / Deployment

To run the app in the development mode, run this command:

    npm start

This starts a development server at `http://localhost:3000`

To build a production version of the app, run this command:

    npm run-script build-app

After running this command, a _packaged_ Javascript file `app.js` is created
and saved in `public/js`.
